Employed second time: Aug 2020 to Feb 2021 at Looking Glass then acquired by ZeroFOX

**Reason for Leaving**

I initially joined LookingGlass Cybersecurity as a Senior Sales Engineer (SE), where I supported enterprise clients by delivering tailored cybersecurity solutions. In May 2020, in response to federal, state, and local COVID-19 shutdowns, LookingGlass shifted its strategic focus, discontinuing public and private sales positions while preparing for a potential partnership with ZeroFOX. This restructuring impacted my role, ending my employment with the company.

One of my key accounts as an SE was the Southern Nevada Counter Terrorism Center (SNCTC), where I had facilitated the onboarding and training of a Cyber Threat Analyst. After leaving LookingGlass, I maintained a professional relationship with SNCTC and learned in August 2020 that their analyst was resigning. With my knowledge of the account, tools, and responsibilities, I was rehired by LookingGlass as a Cyber Threat Analyst 4 to ensure continuity in the role and provide expert support to SNCTC.

Shortly after my return, LookingGlass announced the acquisition of its Managed Threat Intelligence Services (Cyveillance) by ZeroFOX. This transition made me a ZeroFOX employee and part of their expanded threat intelligence team, where I continued to deliver value in cyber threat analysis.

**Role Summary**

As part of the Managed Threat Intelligence Services team, I safeguarded Nevada law enforcement and mitigated threats against the Nevada System of Higher Education by developing actionable strategies to prevent adversarial infiltration and secure critical systems.

Stationed at the Southern Nevada Counter Terrorism Center (SNCTC), a fusion center, I leveraged advanced threat intelligence tools to conduct in-depth research on threat groups, delivering timely intelligence that enhanced external threat visibility. Collaborating with DHS, I published Cyber Awareness Advisories and authored critical reports on major cyber incidents, including supply-chain attacks and ransomware. These publications were disseminated nationally to all fusion centers, contributing to strengthened cybersecurity posture across the country.

#### BlueVoyant | Senior Director, Solutions Engineering, Americas | New York, NY ####
Employed: May 2018 to Oct 2018

**Reason for leaving**

Prior to my employment, Blue Team Global had an incident response engagement with a financial organization. They implemented Carbon Black allowing them to clean up the ransomware. At the conclusion, the financial org asked if Blue Team Global could leave and manage Carbon Black. Blue Team Global then decided to change their name to BlueVoyant and begin developing MDR services. They decided to offer MDR by developing a portal using AlienVault as the SIEM and Demisto as a SOAR. Mid way through developing they hired a sales team in May 2018. It consisted of a hiring the Head of Global Sales, Sales SVP, Senior Director of Sales / Solutions Engineering, Account Executive, and Sales Engineers. After the team was formed there was an immediate issue trying to sell the product, BlueVoyant had not created a portal to integrate the backend (AlienVault / Demisto), and AlienVault had limitations with data, data sources, and reporting. They hired an engineer that was trying to migrate the backend to an ELK stack (Elastic, Logstash, and Kibana). This was going to require more staff to develop, update, and maintain ELK. Leadership had just hired an entire sales team. They decided to discontinue the entire sales team a short six months later impacting my employement.
